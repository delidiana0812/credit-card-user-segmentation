# credit-card-user-segmentation
In this case study, I will analyze the data of credit card users with clustering analysis using the K-Means algorithm. Elbow Method will be used to find the optimal number of clusters in the K-means algorithm. Besides that, I apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to simplify data, by transforming the data linearly.
